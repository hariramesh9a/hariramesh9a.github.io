# Stream Processing Overview

Batch ingestion usually relies on data aggregated over a period of time. Sometimes you need to receive data in real-time, or as close to real-time as possible. Streaming data are generated continuously by thousands of data sources, which typically send in the data records simultaneously, and in small sizes (order of Kilobytes). Streaming data includes a wide variety of data such as log files generated by customers using your mobile or web applications, information from social networks, geospatial services, Internet of Things (IoT) devices that measure air or water quality (or other environmental factors), or telemetry from personal monitoring or fitness devices. 

In this lab scenario,  flight schedule changes and real time updates are made to data lake.

## Kinesis Data Streams

**What is KDS?**

 [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams][1] (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website click streams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events. The data collected is available in milliseconds to enable real-time analytics use cases such as real-time dashboards, real-time anomaly detection, dynamic pricing, and more.
