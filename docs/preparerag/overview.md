# Data Foundations

These are the core elements of a modern, robust data foundation.

- For genAI you need to store various types of data including unstructured, structured, streaming, and vector data that can be used for building and fine-tuning models as well as adding context to prompts through RAG. AWS provides the industry’s most comprehensive set of data services for storing and querying any type of data at scale.

- You’ll also want to make sure that you have ready access to all of your data to leverage for genAI applications. AWS is integrating services our services together and integrating with other data sources so you can break down data silos and get a complete picture of your business or customer. 
 
- Finally, Data needs to be secure and governed throughout the lifecycle of building a genAI application. AWS offers several tools to help ensure data quality, privacy, and access controls so the data you use for genAI applications is high-quality and compliant.



## Data Foundation for GenAI - High level architecture

One of the very first things that gen AI introduces to the pipeline is the need for additional data sources. And these are primarily in the form of unstructured data. Now, unstructured data is not a new construct to the data world, however it is now the dominant part of the data feed for a gen AI pipeline. 

Our typical data architecture patterns have largely dealt with structured data, but with more than 80% of the world’s data in unstructured formats, it is now front and center with gen AI, and has a big influence on data ingestion, data integration and data governance. 
Unstructured data is information that doesn’t conform to a predefined schema or isn’t organized according to a preset data model. Understanding the data, categorizing it, and extracting insights from it can be challenging. Metadata discovery is one of the primary requirements in data analytics.
